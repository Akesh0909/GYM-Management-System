        <h1 style="color: gold;"> Exercises for Abs</h1>
        <p>Let's get one thing straight: This is no late-night informercial, and we're not going to try to sell you
            a single "best ab exercise ever." Too many have tried to make that claim, and it's just not the case.
            The truth is, carving the perfect six-pack requires a variety of exercises and months if not years of
            consistent work. <br>

            That doesn't mean you shouldn't try! It just means you need to get moving. We've put together a full
            slate of top-level choices for building your abs, in no particular order, along with a brief explanation
            of what makes each one great and—when available—the research to back them up.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ease of learning and performing</li>
            <li>Total muscle stimulation and intensity</li>
            <li>Popularity among diehard lifters and bodybuilders (This matters!)</li>
            <li>Availability of equipment in commercial gyms</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Now, let's meet your new favorite ab moves.</p>
        <h3 style="color: gold;">Hanging Knee Raise</h3>
        <img src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/weighted_hanging_crunch-700xh.gif" alt="Reload page">
        <p> <strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> There are many reasons to like leg raises, but top of the list is
            their
            scalability. You can start doing bent-knee raises in a captain's chair or with ab straps to focus on the
            lower core, work up to straight-leg raises, and then move to a hanging bar. By the time you're doing
            full straight-leg toes-to-bar raises, you've built unparalleled strength in your entire core. <br>

            Another point in their favor: You can increase the degree of difficulty and resistance by holding a
            medicine ball between your knees or ankles, allowing you to train in a lower rep range. Or you can add a
            twist at the top or graduate to full-blown "windshield wipers" to target your deeper rotational muscles
            and obliques.
            <br>
            No matter the variation, just remember to use your abs, not momentum, to get your legs as high as
            possible on each rep.
        </p>
        <strong style="color: rgba(9, 255, 0, 0.822);">Hanging Knee Raise Variations for Ab Development: </strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Hanging leg raise </li>
            <li>Captain's chair knee raise </li>
            <li>Parallel bars knee raise </li>
            <li>Hanging dumbbell knee raise </li>
            <li>Hanging toes-to-bar </li>
            <li>Hanging windshield wiper</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <strong>In your workout:</strong> Do this move first or second in your routine for 3 sets of 10-15
            reps,
            or however many
            reps you can do. If using a medicine ball, try a dropset simply by letting go of the medicine ball
            when
            you hit failure.</p>
        <h3 style="color: gold;">Decline Crunch</h3>
        <img src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/incline_abs_crunch-700xh.gif" alt="Reload page">
        <p> <strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> This old-school fave amps up the ab engagement by increasing
            the
            range of motion
            over standard crunches. You can also dial up—or down—the degree of difficulty by adjusting the angle
            of
            the bench. <br>

            Holding a medicine ball, dumbbell, or plate against your chest adds a further level of customizable
            resistance. If you want the ab-chiseling upside of cables or gym machines but don't have access to a
            gym, this is for you. <br>

            Be warned: Since your feet are hooked, it's all too easy to use your hip flexors to come up instead
            of
            your abs. Keep your lower back flat to the bench and your abs engaged. If you're not feeling a
            wicked
            burn, drop all the weight, put your hands on your belly, and really focus on the contraction at a
            slower
            pace.</p>
        <strong style="color: rgba(9, 255, 0, 0.822);">Decline Crunch Variations for Ab Development: </strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Decline oblique crunch </li>
            <li>Decline plate sit-up </li>
            <li>Decline reverse crunch </li>
        </ul>
        <p> <strong>In your workout:</strong> Position this one later in your routine after you've built up some
            fatigue from a really
            challenging first exercise or two. Do 3 sets of 10-15 reps. If you find 15 reps too easy, simply
            increase the angle of decline or use a heavier ball or plate.
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: gold;">Squat</h3>
        <img src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/barbell-back-squat-header-830x467.jpg"
            alt="Reload page ">
        <p> <strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> No, we're not going to echo that old myth that squats and
            deads
            are all you need
            for abs. You need more! But there's no debating that both front and back squats force you to learn
            how
            to brace your abs to maintain a neutral, upright position. And before you say, "It doesn't count if
            you
            wear a lifting belt," a number of studies have shown that a belt actually increases ab activation
            during
            squats.

            <br><br>
            Oh, and don't worry about balancing on a BOSU ball to increase the work of your stabilizers.
            Research
            has shown that if you just go heavy with your squats on the floor, you'll get all the ab stimulus
            you
            need
        </p>

        <strong style="color: rgba(9, 255, 0, 0.822);">Squat Variations for Ab Development:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Barbell front squat </li>
            <li>Goblet squat </li>
            <li>Zercher squat </li>
            <li>Overhead squat</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <strong>In your workout:</strong> Regularly program both back and front squats into your routine. To
            keep
            it interesting,
            rotate through in four-week waves, or alternate weeks between back and fronts. Also, if you're
            following
            a dedicated program like the 7-Day Six-Pack, do your workouts after your heavy leg days, not before.
            The
            last thing you want is to feel sore or weak when you're under the bar!
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: gold;">Russian Twist</h3>
        <img src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/db_russian_twist-700xh.gif" alt="Reload page">
        <p><strong> Why it's on the list:</strong> To recruit the obliques, you need to do one of three motions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bend to the side </li>
            <li>Rotate your trunk </li>
            <li>Suck in your belly</li>
        </ul>
        <p> By adding a medicine ball to the twist, you're hitting your obliques with a double whammy by
            requiring
            the upper abs to contract isometrically to stabilize against the weight as you move. Try to get a
            little
            crunch on either side after the rotation to up the ante.</p>
        <strong style="color: rgba(9, 255, 0, 0.822);">Twist Variations for Ab Development: </strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Russian twist </li>
            <li>Dumbbell Russian twist</li>
            <li>Medicine ball half moon </li>
            <li>Cable lying twist on ball</li>
            <li>Standing cable twist (high to low) </li>
            <li>Standing cable twist (low to high)</li>

        </ul>
        <p> <strong>In your workout:</strong> Do this exercise toward the middle of your routine for 3 sets of
            around
            15 reps per
            side. Increase the degree of difficulty by extending your arms out or using heavier weight.
        </p>
        <h3 style="color: gold;">Plank</h3>
        <img src="https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2021/april/plank-header-830x467.jpg" alt="Reload page">
        <p> <strong>Why it's on the list:</strong> Muscle activation studies consider the plank a mid-level
            exercise.
            But in this
            case, that doesn't tell the whole story. It's first and foremost a great transverse abdominis move,
            but
            that muscle is deep, so can't be measured by EMG.
            <br>
            Planks primarily made the list because of how easily you can use different variations to change the
            level of difficulty. If an elbow plank is too difficult, perform it with the arms straight or simply
            drop to your knees. Too easy? Lift an arm or a leg—or an arm and a leg. Put your feet into
            suspension
            straps or on a stability ball. Each one of these progressions leads to a greater training stimulus
            to
            the abs.
        </p>

        <strong style="color: rgba(9, 255, 0, 0.822);">Plank Variations for Strength and Growth:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Elbow plank </li>
            <li>Side plank </li>
            <li>Plank leg raise </li>
            <li>Feet-elevated plank on ball </li>
            <li>Elbows-elevated plank on ball </li>
            <li>Side plank hip dip</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <strong>In your workout:</strong> You can do these last on ab day, but you can also do them at home
            just
            about any time
            you want. Since it's an isometric move, shoot for time rather than reps. Doing 3-5 sets of 30-90
            seconds
            in whatever variation is toughest for you should get you shaking!</p>
